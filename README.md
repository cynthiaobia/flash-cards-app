# Flash Card App

## Introduction

The Flash Card App is a web application designed to help users create, manage, and study flashcards. It provides an intuitive interface for creating flashcards, organizing them into sets by subject, and flipping through them to reinforce learning. Whether you're a student preparing for exams or simply looking to memorize important information, the Flash Card App has you covered.

## Getting Started

- View the project's planning and progress on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/flash-card-app).
- Access the deployed application at [Flash Card App](https://flash-cards-app-6qim.onrender.com/).

## Unsolved Problems

Currently, the Flash Card App does not support user authentication. In future versions, we plan to implement user accounts to provide a personalized experience and data security.

## Future Enhancements

In the upcoming releases of the Flash Card App, we plan to introduce the following enhancements:

- Improved card set organization and categorization features.
- Integration with external learning resources and APIs.
- Mobile application versions for iOS and Android.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help us make the Flash Card App even better!
